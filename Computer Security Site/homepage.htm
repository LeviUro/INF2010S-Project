      <h3>What is Computer Security?</h3>
      <p> Computer security, also known as cyber security or IT security, is the protection of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. </p>
      <p>Cyber security includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection. Also, due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, IT security is susceptible to being tricked into deviating from secure procedures through various methods.</p>
      <p>The field is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems and the Internet, wireless networks such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions and tiny devices as part of the Internet of Things. </p>

      <h3>Why is Computer Security Important?</h3>
      <p>Computer Security allows the groups to carry out its mission by: Enabling people to carry out their jobs, education, and research, supporting critical business process and by protecting personal and sensitive information.</p>
      <p>Email serves the same purpose at most organizations that phone calls and corporate memos did in the 1990s. Because there is proprietary information being passed back and forth, each organization assumes the responsibility of ensuring every email account is secure. Security specialists may be asked to help onboard the system, and then protect the organization from potential risks as they arise. In the event that an employees email is breached, it is up to the specialist to identify and eradicate the problem. Once that is done, the next priority becomes ensuring that all the other in-house accounts remain secure from that threat as well.</p>
      <p>Employees at many organizations are required to do some online searches. The problem is that the more searches that are done, the higher the risk that an individual might click on a contaminated link. Within minutes the entire computer could be infected. Network specialists are trained to set up firewalls that can either warn users of a potential threat before allowing them to access a page, or forbid them from accessing any unsecure pages altogether. This minimizes the organizations exposure and forces every user to think twice before clicking.</p>
      <p>The occasional breach is also unavoidable - The larger the organization, the more common it is for a simple virus to infect the system. Network specialists are there to put out the fire when it does occur, and they are essential to the organization in that manner. Depending on the specialists role, this may mean accepting the occasional independent contract, or it may mean working for an employer full-time. The most important duty for a full-time specialist is to keep an eye out for emerging threats before they arise. Lost or breached information can represent a major expense, and the more vigilant a networking specialist, the less exposed any organization will be. <img src="_images/security2.jpg" alt="W3C logo" width="200" height="136" class="flowLeft"></p>

      <h3>Guarding against cyber crimes:</h3>
      <p>The internet itself is considered an unsecured network. It is a scary truth when we realize it is essentially the backbone for how we give and receive information. That is where internet security (or cyber security) comes in, and it is a term that can get pretty broad, as well. This branch of security is technically a part of computer security that deals specifically with the way information is sent and received in browsers. It is also related to network security and how networks interact with web-based applications.</p>
      <p>To protect us against unwittingly sharing our private information all over the web, there are different standards and protocols for how information is sent over the internet. There are ways to block intrusions with firewalls, anti-malware, and anti-spyware, anything designed to monitor incoming internet traffic for unwanted traffic or malware like spyware, adware, or Trojans.If these measures do not stop hackers from getting through, encryption can make it harder for them to do much with your data by encoding it in a way that only authorized users can decrypt, whether that data is in transit between computers, browsers, and websites, or at rest on servers and databases.</p>
